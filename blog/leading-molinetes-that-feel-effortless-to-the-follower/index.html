side step, back cross, side step</li><li>Leaders are taught to lead the molinete by turning in place while keeping the chest turned
slightly ahead of the hips. This opens space on one side of the body, which the follower
will step into. As long as the leader continues turning, that opened space will stay ahead
of the follower, and they will continue the molinete pattern.
</li></ul><p>The molinete pattern is so commonly understood by followers that this way of leading it works
great, and also allows the freedom to create many fun and interesting leader embellishments.
</p><p>But, let's take a closer look at one of the follower's molinete steps to see whether there
is an opportunity here to create a more enjoyable and connected dance for the follower.
Because better connection is better tango.
</p><h3>The follower's back cross</h3><p>A follower using good technique is always stepping closely around their leader during a
molinete, rather than stepping away from the leader. Simultaneously, the follower is keeping
their torso rotated toward the leader as much as possible. Put these two ideas together in
the back cross of the molinete, and you get a step which demands an extensive spiral through
the follower's body. Beginning leaders may never have used such a full body spiral, but
beginning followers must tackle it almost immediately to learn the molinete correctly. It
looks like this:
</p><img class="centered blog-post-image" style="width: 145px;" src="/static/img/molinete_back_cross.jpg" alt="Back cross of the molinete"><p>Notice that the follower's torso is nearly facing the leader's chest, while the hips are
turned a full 90-degrees. Her leg extends around and toward the leader, spiraling even
further than her hips. While in this position, she must remain perfectly balanced on her
weighted foot. Leaders, if you have never tried this yourself, then ask someone to lead you
in a molinete. If your body is not spiraled enough when you execute the back cross, you will
not be able to step around them sufficiently, or not be able to keep your chest facing
toward their chest. Beginning followers face these same challenges.
</p><p>You might also just fall over.</p><h3>Accommodating the back cross</h3><p>Now that we have an appreciation for the difficulty of this step, let's see what we can do
about it. Keep in mind that the follower is striving to face the leader's chest. If the
leader keeps the chest slightly ahead of the follower, as is done when leading the molinete,
then the follower's chest can't spiral enough to face it squarely during the back cross.
Followers will respond with as much spiral as possible, but necessarily fall short. Although
this is typically fine, leaders have an opportunity here to create a nicer and more connected
back cross for the follower by adjusting their chest position.
</p><p>Here's how:</p><p>Leaders, as the follower takes their side step just before the back cross, allow your lower
body to catch up to your torso as the follower finishes the side step and collects. At this
point, this is what you would do if you wanted the molinete to end at this step. Your partner
should be directly in front of you with your bodies facing each other. Do not stop the energy
in this position, however. Instead, make sure your right foot is weighted (for a
counter-clockwise molinete). Bend your knees more than normal and simultaneously move the
right half of your chest forward and slightly rotated toward your partner in the direction of
their back cross. What you are doing here is two-fold. The extra flex in your knees will
allow your follower to do the same, which creates additional stability and a longer step
length in the back cross. Simultaneously you are moving your torso slightly around the
outside of your partner in the direction they need to pivot for the back cross. This is
similar to what your chest does to lead the pivot in an ocho. This makes the pivot much
easier for the follower without requiring as much body spiral. You have just created a
position between the leader and the follower which ameliorates many of the challenging
aspects of this step.
</p><p>After you have led your partner to finish the back cross, you can square up your chest
during the follower's next step (the side step), and then rotate your torso slightly ahead
of your lower body to initiate the follower's forward cross. You are now back in the body
position you started with and can repeat this process, if you like, for another molinete turn.
</p><h3>Bonus side effects</h3><p>This method of leading a molinete not only affects your connection with the follower during
the back cross. It connects the leader and follower through every one of the steps. Notice
that you end up square with your partner during each side step, and you rotate your chest
ahead of your partner just for their front cross. This is how each of these separate steps
would be lead if there was no molinete pattern. Consequently, you are fully engaged with each
of your partner's steps throughout the pattern. The difference in feeling can be dramatic.
</p><p>Once you are comfortable incorporating this style into your molinetes, experiment with
changing the energy you put into the follower's pivot on the back cross. If you give lots of
pivot energy and bend your knees more, then you will get a quick pivot that adds a lot of
momentum to the follower's turn. And if you maintain that momentum for the next steps, the
follower will take them twice as fast. This can be a wonderful way to accent a traspie-like
rhythm in the music.
</p><h3>Final Note</h3><p>This technique is best suited for a straight-forward molinete, rather than one with more
advanced leader embellishments such as enrosques. It can be a useful aid when dancing with
beginning followers to help them keep a tight back cross around your body. However, even for
experienced followers, it communicates extra connection and is useful to indicate speed
changes within the molinete. No matter who you are dancing with, it can turn an otherwise
typical molinete into something much more exciting.</p></article><p class="blog-date">Posted 2/28/2013</p><div id="blog-categories"><h3><a href="/blog/category/">Blog Categories</a></h3><ul><li><a href="/blog/category/django/">django</a>
