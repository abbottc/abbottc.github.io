another. The function <code>f(x)=x+3</code>, for example, is just a way of saying that I'm matching
up the number 1 with the number 4, the number 2 with the number 5, etc. A different example
would be the absolute value function which matches both -4 and +4 to the number +4. Think of
functions as matchmakers.
</p><h3>Functions may be "injective" (or "one-to-one")</h3><p>An injective function is a matchmaker that is not from Utah. There are no polyamorous matches
like the absolute value function, there are just one-to-one matches like <code>f(x)=x+3</code>.
</p><p>Lets take two sets of numbers A and B. Say we know an injective function exists between them.
That means we know every number in A has a single unique match in B. But, we don't know whether
there are any numbers in B that are "left out" and aren't matched to anything. If you think
about it, this implies the size of set A must be less than or equal to the size of set B.
That's an important consequence of injective functions, which is one reason they come up a lot.
</p><div class="function-example"><p class="function-example-section"><span class="function-example-lead">Example:</span><code>f(x) = x!</code> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" target="_blank">factorial function</a>)
where both sets A and B are the set of all positive integers (1, 2, 3...).</p><p class="function-example-section"><span class="function-example-lead">Why it's injective:</span>Everything in set A matches to something in B because factorials only produce positive
integers. And no duplicate matches exist, because 1! < 2! < 3! < 4!... meaning none of the
factorials will be the same number. Note that in this example, there are numbers in B which
are unmatched (e.g. 3, 4, 5, or 7). Remember that injective functions don't mind whether
some of B gets "left out".
</p></div><h3>Functions may be "surjective" (or "onto")</h3><p>There are also surjective functions. Surjective functions are matchmakers who make sure they
find a match for all of set B, and who don't mind using polyamory to do it. So, if you know a
surjective function exists between set A and B, that means every number in B is matched to
one or more numbers in A. Again if you think about it, this implies that the size of set A
must be greater than or equal to the size of set B. Another important consequence.
</p><div class="function-example"><p class="function-example-section"><span class="function-example-lead">Example:</span><code>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></code> where A is the set of real numbers and B is the set of non-negative
real numbers.</p><p class="function-example-section"><span class="function-example-lead">Why it's surjective:</span>The entirety of set B is matched because every non-negative real number has a real number
which squares to it (namely, its square root). Note that in this example, polyamory is
pervasive, because nearly all numbers in B have 2 matches from A (the positive and negative
square root).
</p></div><h3>Bijective Functions</h3><p>Finally, a bijective function is one that is both injective and surjective. If a bijective
function exists between A and B, then you know that the size of A is less than or equal to B
(from being injective), and that the size of A is also greater than or equal to B (from being
surjective). The only possibility then is that the size of A must in fact be exactly equal to
the size of B. Just like if a value x is less than or equal to 5, and also greater than or
equal to 5, then it can only be 5.
</p><div class="function-example"><p class="function-example-section"><span class="function-example-lead">Example:</span><code>f(x) = 2x</code> where A is the set of integers and B is the set of even integers.</p><p class="function-example-section"><span class="function-example-lead">Why it's bijective:</span>All of A has a match in B because every integer when doubled becomes even. This match is
unique because when we take half of any particular even number, there is only one possible
result. This makes the function injective. The function is also surjective because
nothing in B is "left over", that is, there is no even integer that can't be found by
doubling some other integer. Since the matching function is both injective and surjective,
that means it's bijective, and consequently, both A and B are exactly the same size. If
you think about what A and B contain, intuition would lead to the assumption that B might
be half the size of A. But surprisingly, intuition turns out to be wrong here. And this
leads to our conclusion...
</p></div><h3>How this relates to infinite sets</h3><p>So, for any two sets where you can find a bijective function between them, you know the sets
are exactly the same size. Even infinite sets. This is how Georg Cantor was able to show
which infinite sets were the same size. He found bijections between them.
</p><p>Cantor was able to show which infinite sets were strictly smaller than others by
demonstrating how any possible injective function existing between them still left unmatched
numbers in the second set. In other words, any function which used up all of A in uniquely
matching to B still didn't use up all of B. Therefore, B must be bigger in size.
</p><p>Cantor proceeded to show there were an infinite number of sizes of infinite sets! But
perhaps I'll save that remarkable piece of mathematics for another time.</p></article><p class="blog-date">Posted 1/25/2013</p><div id="blog-categories"><h3><a href="/blog/category/">Blog Categories</a></h3><ul><li><a href="/blog/category/django/">django</a>
