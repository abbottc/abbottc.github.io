Learning it usually begins by substantially
undermining our confidence in something we thought we had mastered at age two: walking. And
for leaders, we are suddenly responsible for guiding the steps of two people, while we may
not even be sure we should be responsible for one. So what exactly does a leader need to do
to create a synchronized dance step, rather than a forced movement in a somewhat ambiguous
direction? Let's take a look at the breakdown:
</p><h3>Indicating a step without stepping</h3><p>Here's a great exercise you can do anywhere:</p><p>Stand in a nice, tall tango posture with the knees slightly bent, torso slightly forward,
weight only on one foot, with the other leg relaxed. This position should feel comfortable,
yet engaged. Now, soften your weighted knee even more, so that it feels bouyant and flexible.
Move your chest straight forward slightly by adjusting your weight to the front part of the
ball of your foot. Note that the ball of your foot is not a point, but a small area in which
you can shift your weight around.  See how far you can project yourself forward without losing
your balance, then come back to center. Try the same thing to the side and backward. At no time
should your weight move off of your one foot. Practice this a bit each day, and aim to increase
how far you can project in each direction. Your goal is to comfortably and clearly move your
chest in a particular direction without any risk to your balance.

Keep in mind that you have not yet begun to step yourself. One of the paramount ideas in
leading tango is that the leader indicates a step, but does not actually step until just
after the follower. There is only the illusion of stepping simultaneously.
</p><p>Remember that these chest movements are relatively small, but when they are done in an
engaged tango embrace, they come across to an attentive follow as if through a megaphone.
</p><img class="centered blog-post-image" style="width: 132px;" src="/static/img/megaphone.gif" alt="Don't actually do this"><p class="blog-post-caption">"I'm now moving forward"</p><h3>A little knee can go a long way</h3><p>It can be useful to bend your unweighted knee slightly forward as you project your torso.
This puts the leader's whole body in a position more like how we naturally start a step.
Remember that your partner is connected with your chest movement and not your knee, so this
only works because of the way the slightly forward knee affects your chest position. In
other words, if you take care to move your knee together with your chest, and never project
your unweighted knee further than your chest, this technique can be very clear and connected
for the follower.

follower's knees are. The lower down your partner is, the farther they can extend their leg.
The leader influences this with their height. If you stay tall when you project your torso,
your partner will not be able to extend as far and a shorter step will result. Alternatively,
if you bend your knees significantly before projecting, your partner will match that and be
able to extend the leg further for a longer step. Varying your height and step length to
correspond to different parts of the music can be a very expressive way to dance.

the follower is kept lower and the step is longer.
</p><h3>Becoming the follower</h3><p>When your partner feels the projection of your torso, they will respond by extending their
unweighted leg in the direction you are indicating. Recall that you have not yet moved your
feet, so let's look one more time at the position that results. The follower extends before
you step:
</p><img class="centered blog-post-image" style="width: 118px" src="/static/img/tango_extension_3.jpg" alt="Follower's leg extension prior to lead's step"><p>And now comes the part that is perhaps the most challenging for leaders. You must switch
gears and become a follow yourself. This means that when your partner extends their leg, you
must tune in to this, and begin following your partner's response to your own lead. Why?
Because the follower is about to take a step of a certain size and in a certain direction. It
may be exactly what you had in mind, or it may not. Regardless, your goal is to match your
follower's step at this point, and not simply to take your own intended step.
<em>This creates smoothness in the dance because both partners remain together and connected.</em>
</p><p>Let's look at how to do that:</p><p>When your partner's leg extends, you will feel it in their upper body. Pay attention to their
hip and lower rib cage moving slightly back to create space for you. You should not feel your
partner transfer weight onto the extended leg at this point. This body communication is subtle
and requires good follower technique. Your goal is to gauge from your partner's upper body how
much their leg is extended so you can match it. This is something to practice on each step.
</p><p>As a side note, since the follower has not yet changed weight, it is possible to bring your
own torso back to center causing the follower's leg to collect again without stepping. Many
creative movements can come from guiding the follower's unweighted leg around with your torso
without completing the step. It's an idea well worth exploring. But typically, your
follower's leg is extended by itself for only a very brief moment. When you feel the
extension, you know there is now an opening for your step. Extend your unweighted leg to fill
that space and take care to match the amount of extension made by your follower. The
quickness of this action creates the illusion of simultaneous steps, when in reality you are
following the extension of your partner.

</p><h3>Leading the change of weight</h3><p>This point can be missed by both leaders and followers. The leader not only initiates the
step, but also leads the weight change. Signaling the weight change is accomplished by the
leader pushing off of his weighted foot to transfer his weight onto his extended foot. This
pushing off moves the follower from their axis, and the follower will respond by pushing off
of their own weighted foot. The lead can create extra length in the step by pushing off with
greater energy. However, be careful that the momentum is not more than is needed to get you
and your partner squarely onto your other foot. Otherwise, you will push your follower past
their new axis, and the step will end off balance. And that will definitely not get you a
second tanda.
</p><h3>Leading precision foot placement</h3><p>If both partners are following good technique, then the leader will be able to land the
follower's foot in an exact spot on the dance floor at the end of the weight change. This
opens up a multitude of possibilities for interesting tango movements which require a high
level of precision. The follower's foot placement is affected mainly by three things:
</p><ul class="blog-post-list"><li>Sending more or less energy in your initial torso movement, which causes the follower's
extension to happen faster or slower</li><li>Timing the weight change to occur when the follower's foot reaches the right place
(remember that to get a longer step, you must begin with your knees more flexed so that the
follower's leg can extend further)</li><li>Pushing off of your weighted foot with the right amount of energy to either land the
follower's foot where it is, or send it even further
</li></ul><img class="centered blog-post-image" style="width: 352px;" src="/static/img/precise_step.jpg"><p class="blog-post-caption">Or, you could just point</p><h3>The feeling of a wave</h3><p>After the weight change, both partners allow their newly unweighted leg to collect underneath
their new axis. This has the feeling of dissipating the energy of the step. There is
something interesting about the level of energy experienced throughout the tango step. When
the leader initiates the intention of the step and the follower extends, there is the feeling
of a build-up of energy. This build-up leads into the push-off from the weighted foot for
both partners, which is where the peak energy is felt. The collection portion of the step
uses up the energy from the push-off and we're back to a point of rest. And the process
happens again for the next step. This produces the sensation of little waves in the amount of
energy present throughout each step. That ebb and flow of energy, when it is crafted to
coincide with the rhythm of music, is what produces the sensation of dancing.
</p><p>And that is why this very complex series of body movements that create the basic step of
Argentine tango is in fact what separates the act of walking from the experience of dancing
tango.
</p><h3>And finally... How it all looks in motion</h3><p>Watch the opening 25 seconds of this performance by Luciano Brigante and Alejandra Orozco to
see how each piece discussed here comes together into the action of the tango walk:

direction, rather than just your chest alone.
</li><li>When leading the weight change, focus on the foot you transfer weight from. The tendency is
to think about the foot we land on, but what really matters is putting the right amount
of energy into pushing off from the other foot.
</li><li>Remember to keep your torso, shoulders, and arms all moving together as a single unit in
the embrace. Especially in an open embrace, flimsy upper body joints will cause your chest
movements to become ambiguous to the follower. Similarly, you do not want to lead by only
moving your arms without moving your chest. To counter these problems, try practicing what
Homer & Christina Ladas call the "tea kettle" embrace. This embrace removes your arms from
the equation. The leader's hands are behind the back while the follower holds onto the
bicep area, as shown here:
